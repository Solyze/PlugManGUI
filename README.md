# PlugManGUI
Plugin "Extension" for PlugMan. Allows you to manage plugins in a GUI. 
The plugin was developed as a fun utility project. When using PlugMan, a thought suddenly rushed to mind about creating a GUI plugin for it, an "Extension". 
All credit for PlugMan goes to rylinaux - you can download [PlugMan](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman) here.
